# Project Charter

<!--
This template guides you in creating your project's constitution.
The charter is a governance document that guides all decisions and AI behavior.
Fill in each section thoughtfully - this document shapes your entire project.

Tips:
- Be specific but concise
- Revisit and update as the project evolves
- Use this document to align stakeholders and guide AI assistance
- Remove these comments when complete
-->

## Mission

<!-- One clear sentence: What does this project exist to accomplish?
     Good: "Reduce hospital readmissions for heart failure patients through AI-powered care coordination"
     Bad: "Make healthcare better"
     Good: "Build a collaborative text editor with real-time multiplayer editing"
     Bad: "Create a web application"
-->

[One sentence mission statement]

## Principles

<!-- 3-5 core principles that inform ALL decisions in this project.
     These should be specific to your project, not generic platitudes.
     Ask: "If we face a tough choice, what values guide us?"

     Examples:
     - Privacy-first: User data never leaves their device
     - Evidence-based: Every intervention backed by peer-reviewed research
     - Accessibility-first: WCAG AAA compliance is non-negotiable
     - Fail-safe: System defaults to safe state on any error
     - Community-driven: Feature decisions based on user research, not assumptions

## Scope

<!-- Clear boundaries prevent scope creep and guide decisions.
     Be explicit about what you WILL and WON'T do.
-->

### In Scope

<!-- What this project WILL do. Be specific about:
     - Features/capabilities
     - User groups served
     - Problems addressed
     - Deliverables

     Examples:
     - Web-based interface for desktop and mobile browsers
     - Support for English and Spanish languages
     - Integration with existing EHR systems via FHIR API
     - Intervention delivery during business hours only
-->

- [Specific feature/capability]
- [Specific feature/capability]
- [User groups/stakeholders served]
- [Deliverables/outputs]

### Out of Scope

<!-- What this project will NOT do. Being explicit about this is critical.
     Include things that users/stakeholders might EXPECT but you won't deliver.

     Examples:
     - Native mobile apps (web only for MVP)
     - 24/7 monitoring (business hours only)
     - Support for legacy systems pre-2015
     - Diagnostic capabilities (care coordination only)
     - Multi-language support beyond English/Spanish

## Stakeholders

<!-- Who is involved in or affected by this project?
     Include both contributors and beneficiaries.

     Examples:
     - Primary users: Nurses coordinating patient discharge
     - Secondary users: Patients receiving follow-up care
     - Contributors: Development team, clinical advisory board
     - Beneficiaries: Hospital administrators (reduced readmissions)
     - Affected parties: IT department (maintains integration)
-->

**Primary Users/Beneficiaries:**

**Contributors:**
- [Who builds/maintains this project]

**Secondary Stakeholders:**
- [Who is indirectly affected or has input]

**Advisory/Oversight:**

## Success Criteria

<!-- How do you know when you've succeeded?
     Be specific and measurable where possible.
     Think: outcomes, not just outputs.

     Examples:
     - Reduce 30-day readmission rate by 15% within 6 months
     - Support 100 concurrent users with <200ms latency
     - Achieve 80% user satisfaction in post-deployment survey
     - Publish 3 peer-reviewed papers using the research platform
     - Complete IRB approval and enroll first participant by Q2 2026
